# Potato Indexer

> It was pointed out that the correct term is **Table of Contents**, so if you see indexer/index anywhere just know that it means _Table of Contents_. Sorry for the confusion :)

If you've ever needed an easy way to generate a table of contents for your note or for a sub-section of your note, then you're in luck!

With this super simple plugin all you have to do is open the command palette, `Ctrl`(on MacOS `CMD`) + `P`, and search for `potato indexer`.

Two commands will show:

- Generate table of contents for current note
- Generate table of contents for selected content. This requires you to select the existing index in case of an update.

Pick whichever suits your needs at that moment.
