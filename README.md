# Potato Indexer

If you've every needed an easy way to generate content indexes for your note or for a sub-section of your note, then you're in luck!

With this super simple plugin all you have to do is open the command palette, `Ctrl`(on MacOS `CMD`) + `P`, and search for indexer.

- Generate index for current note
- Generate index for selected content. This requires you to select the existing index in case of an update.

Pick whichever suits your needs at that moment.
