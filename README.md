# Potato Indexer

If you've every needed an easy way to generate content indexes for your note or for a sub-section of your note, then you're in luck!

With this super simple plugin all you have to do is open the command palette, `Ctrl`(on MacOS `CMD`) + `P`, and search for indexer.

Two commands will show:

- Generate index for current note
- Generate index for selected content

Pick whichever suits your needs at that moment.

## Improvements

- [ ] Instead of replacing the whole file, try and replace just the specific sections where the index is or is to be inserted;
- [x] When generating the tabs, do it based on how many titles there are. If I select a h2 title and h3 it will have two tabs instead of 1 and 2;
